      <p>The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides eligible employees with up to 12 workweeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for specified family and medical reasons. Employers must determine coverage and eligibility, give required notices, and track leave accurately (DOL, 2024b).</p>
<p>Intermittent leave and coordination with ADA or state laws are common pain points; clear workflows and manager training reduce risk (SHRM, 2022).</p>

          <p>Coverage typically applies to private employers with 50+ employees within 75 miles. Eligibility requires 12 months of service and 1,250 hours worked in the prior 12 months (DOL, 2024b). Use the DOL’s model notices and medical certification forms to standardize communication and deadlines.</p>
<p>Intermittent leave requires precise tracking. Adopt a consistent increment (e.g., 15 minutes), sync with payroll/timekeeping, and ensure benefits continuation is billed correctly. Supervisors should avoid discouraging use of leave or taking adverse actions related to it (SHRM, 2022).</p>
<p>When FMLA overlaps with ADA or state leave laws, evaluate each and apply the provision most favorable to the employee. Update your handbook annually and train managers to recognize leave requests, even when employees don’t say “FMLA” (DOL, 2024b).</p>
<p>Create a simple intake workflow: notice from employee, eligibility/rights & responsibilities notice, certification due date, designation notice, tracking of usage, and return-to-work. Keep files confidential and separate from personnel records.</p>
<p>Quarterly spot checks—pull a few files and verify forms, dates, and calculations—help keep the process clean and defensible.</p>
